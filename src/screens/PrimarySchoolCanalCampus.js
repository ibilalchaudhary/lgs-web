                  and opportunities as possible and given the freedom to explore
                  and question them. We want our students to form their own
                  opinions and make their own choices. We strongly encourage our
                  students to take part in extra curricular activities and
                  community service projects as well. We aim to provide a
                  learning environment that enables our children to be thinking,
                  socially responsible, well rounded individuals.

                  At LGS we aim to foster that kind of independence and
                  self-belief. We encourage our young children to learn by doing
                  and to discover things for themselves. We appreciate
                  childrenâ€™s creativity and are not looking for a perfect
                  product. We look at the process of learning and making
                  connections; this is what we feel has real value.
